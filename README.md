Project from Unity Junior Programmer Pathway. 
Idea: to set up a Main Menu UI where user adds a name before starting the game. 
Once the game is over, save score and update the best score if necessary.
The game should be able to save the best score between sessions.
Additionally, I added multiple levels to make the game more challenging.
